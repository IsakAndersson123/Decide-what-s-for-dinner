# Decide what's for dinner

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about registering what you have in the fridge with what you just bought in the store, to be able to get recipes or inspiration for meals to eat in an app. The app should keep track of best before dates. When you consume something, it is recorded in the app so it is continuously updated.

Building AI course project

## Background

Problem solved: 
* Using the food items before they expires
* Insperation on what to eat 

How common or frequent is this problem?
* Approx 59 kg of food per household is thrown away per year in Sweden
* Not knowing what to eat is quite common

What is your personal motivation?
* Easier to decide what to eat and what i need to purchase.

Why is this topic important or interesting?
* Increased interest in changing towards a more climate-friendly society


## How is it used?

Its an app in your phone where you start by writing down what food you have at home. When you shop, you take photos of receipts and the app automatically registers new purchases. When you cook, you enter in the app (eg: used 2 deciliters of XYZ). The user group is broad and has many possible users. Usually those who have a household and usually cook.


## Data sources and AI methods
The input data regarding the amount of food, comes from the user. The recipes come from the app, the recipes are produced by checking what the user has at home and which recipes if there are ingredients for them.


## Challenges
Challenges with the app are that it can be difficult for the user to know exactly how much of the food they have used. The difficulty with that is that then there may not be enough food to make certain dishes and that there is enough for the specified number of portions.


## What next?

To make this project possible, we need someone who is good at coding who can build the app. Then a large database of recipes is needed. Once everything is in place, you can start marketing the service


## Acknowledgments

* Insperation foundation from the app: Kurr, but more developed.
